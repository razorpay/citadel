* **What**: CMS for Documentation
* **Why**: We are making our own in house content management system for reducing the pain of our technical writers.
     This will support many features apart from being a standard CMS.
* **How**: This project is based on React with Github as Backend.

To start developing
1. Clone it
2. Do npm install (one for root and one for cms dir)
3. Do npm start

And you are good to go.
