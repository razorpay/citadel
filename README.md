CMS for Documentation

- This is a content management system to be used by our tech-writers team to publish, review changes in their docs before going to production.

# Motivation
The current setup for reviewing changes in docs happens through github which gets complicated sometimes. This CMS will work similary like github. Features will be more handy and easy like 
  - Commenting (like in google docs) - Currently handled by the github review system
  - Drafting 
  - Version control
  - Previewing (currently we use beta env)
  and many more.
  
  All the head over of git commands is to be reduced.
