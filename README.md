# Citadel
CMS for Documentation

- This is a content management system for tech-writers team to publish, review, update docs[https://razorpay.com/docs/].  

# Motivation
The current system is very complex as it requires github interactions and lacks some important features. The aim is to introduce an easier authoring user interface. This CMS will use github in background hiding the technical complexities and will support features like :
  - Commenting (like in Google Docs) - Currently handled by the github review system
  - Drafting 
  - Version control
  - Previewing (currently we use beta env)
  and many more.
